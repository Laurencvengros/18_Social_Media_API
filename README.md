## Description

A social network API that uses Mongo DB as a database, Mongoose ODM, Express.JS and seeds data through insomnia. It allows you to create your own user, share your thoughts, add others as friends and add reactions to your friends thoughts.

With this API you can also complete other CRUD operations. The photo below shows all the requests you may send including GET, POST, PUT and DELETE users, thoughts, friends and reactions
